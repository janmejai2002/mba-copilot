# 🧠 Knowledge Graph - Feature Guide

## What Makes This Graph Special?

Unlike traditional mind maps, this is a **living, intelligent network** that:
- ✅ Builds automatically as you attend lectures
- ✅ Shows hidden connections between concepts
- ✅ Recommends optimal study order
- ✅ Identifies foundational "must-know" concepts
- ✅ Exports ready-to-use study guides

## 🎯 Key Features Explained

### 1. **Smart Learning Path** 🛤️
**What it does:** Analyzes all concepts and creates an optimal study sequence.

**How it works:**
- Identifies foundational concepts (highly connected nodes)
- Considers chronological order from lecture
- Prioritizes prerequisites before advanced topics

**How to use:**
1. Click "Learning Path" button
2. Follow the numbered sequence (1 → N)
3. Golden rings highlight the recommended path
4. Study concepts in order for best comprehension

**Why it matters:** Instead of random review, you build knowledge systematically.

### 2. **Concept Importance Indicators** 📊

**Visual Cues:**
- **Large nodes** = Highly connected (important concepts)
- **Dashed rings** = "Hub" concepts (3+ connections)
- **Thick links** = Strong relationship between concepts

**What to focus on:**
- Nodes with dashed rings are usually exam-critical
- Large nodes are foundational - master these first
- Isolated nodes might be examples or side topics

---

### 3. **Interactive Search & Filter** 🔍

**Search Box:**
- Type any keyword to find related concepts
- Searches both titles and explanations
- Real-time filtering

**Category Filter:**
- **Concepts** (Purple): Core ideas and definitions
- **Formulas** (Blue): Mathematical equations and calculations
- **Examples** (Amber): Case studies and real-world applications
- **Trends** (Green): Market trends and growth patterns

**Pro Tip:** Filter by "Formula" before exams to review all calculations.

---

### 4. **Connection Exploration** 🔗

**Hover over any node to:**
- Highlight connected concepts
- Dim unrelated nodes
- See relationship strength (link thickness)

**Click a node to:**
- View full explanation
- See timestamp (when it appeared in lecture)
- Check connection count
- Identify category

**Why it's useful:** Understand how concepts relate and build on each other.

---

### 5. **Export Study Guide** 📄

**What you get:**
- Markdown file with all concepts
- Ordered by recommended learning path
- Includes categories and explanations
- Shows connection counts (importance metric)

**How to use:**
1. Click "Export Guide" button
2. Opens as `study-guide.md`
3. Import to Notion, Obsidian, or print directly
4. Use as your primary revision material

**Best for:** Creating structured notes for exam prep.

---

### 6. **Zoom & Pan Controls** 🔎

**Mouse/Trackpad:**
- **Scroll** to zoom in/out
- **Click + Drag background** to pan
- **Drag nodes** to rearrange

**Buttons:**
- **+** Zoom in
- **-** Zoom out
- **⟲** Reset to center
- **⛶** Fullscreen mode

**Pro Tip:** Use fullscreen for complex graphs with 20+ concepts.

## 🎓 Study Strategies Using the Graph

### Strategy 1: **Pre-Exam Review**
1. Open Knowledge Graph
2. Click "Learning Path"
3. Review concepts in numbered order
4. Focus extra time on nodes with dashed rings

### Strategy 2: **Concept Mastery Check**
1. Pick a large node (foundational concept)
2. Click to view explanation
3. Hover to see all connected concepts
4. Can you explain each connection? If not, review those nodes.

### Strategy 3: **Quick Topic Lookup**
1. Use search box to find specific concept
2. Click the node for full explanation
3. Check connected nodes for related topics
4. Export filtered view as mini study guide

### Strategy 4: **Identify Weak Areas**
1. Filter by category (e.g., "Formulas")
2. Review all nodes in that category
3. Click nodes you don't fully understand
4. Create targeted study plan for those concepts

## 🔬 Understanding the Algorithm

### How Connections Are Made:
1. **Word Similarity**: Concepts sharing keywords get linked
2. **Chronological Flow**: Sequential concepts from lecture are connected
3. **Strength Calculation**: More shared words = stronger link = thicker line

### Node Positioning:
- **Force Simulation**: Nodes push/pull based on connections
- **Natural Clustering**: Related concepts group together
- **Physics-Based**: Graph self-organizes for clarity

### Learning Path Logic:
1. Count connections for each concept
2. Sort by importance (connection count)
3. Respect chronological order for equal importance
4. Result: Foundational concepts first, advanced topics later

## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **Use During Lecture**: Watch the graph build in real-time to see concept flow
2. **Compare Sessions**: Notice which concepts appear across multiple lectures
3. **Study Groups**: Share exported study guides with classmates
4. **Revision Cycles**: Re-export guide before each exam for updated content
5. **Visual Memory**: The graph layout helps with spatial memory recall

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

**Graph looks cluttered:**
- Use search/filter to focus on specific topics
- Zoom in to see details
- Drag nodes apart for better spacing

**Can't find a concept:**
- Check if search is active (clear search box)
- Verify category filter is set to "All"
- Concept might not have been extracted yet (wait for AI processing)

**Export not working:**
- Check browser download permissions
- Try different browser if issue persists
- File saves as `study-guide.md` in Downloads folder
